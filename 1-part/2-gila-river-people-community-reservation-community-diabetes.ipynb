    "The Akimel O’odham, or Gila River People, who were noted for their technological prowess and agricultural skills, live in America. After the Americas was colonized by the British, and subsequently gained it's independence their diet changed significantly from their mostly farmed diet. This caused high levels of diabetes in a localised area, that prior studies hadn't found before this diet change.\n",

    "In 1965, the Epidemiology and Field Studies Branch of the National Institute of Arthritis, Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (catchy name, I know) in partnership with the Indian Health Service sent a team to begin an observational study of the Pima community at Gila River. The research lasted 40 years, and has been one of the most important bits of research involving diabetes.\n",
