# tensorflow-learning
My notes from learning about tensorflow!

Note: I feel pretty uncomfortable about my learning journey here. I don't recommend you follow exactly what I did, maybe skip to the wine one if you are curious. The dataset I used for the first one was recommended in a tutorial and it makes me pretty unhappy. Also the strategy of doing grid searches isn't really ideal in my opinion for that data. I leave it here for my own reference, but still. Not great. Hopefully I can pull this together into something more cogent at some point.
